Etch-a-Sketch

This is an in-browser version of an Etch-a-Sketch board. The user can draw on it by moving the mouse over the white squares, which then become colorful. Shading is possible because repeated hovering over a square darkens its color until it eventually turns black.

Skills I've practiced while working on this project:
> manipulating DOM elements in Javascript
> creating a relative number of nodes using Javascript
> using Eventlisteners
> manipulating node attributes (such as color) in Javascript
